I have Incursion mechanic questions:

- Should I upgrade or switch undesirable rooms?
- Should I leave maps as soon as a desirable room is found?

I got conflicting information on TFT discord and maxroll.gg guides, so I decided to experiment myself.

This repo exists to improve and document my experimentation process.

Currently, running gui.py will open a gui for tracking Incursions and outputting logs to logs folder.
